# archme
 A clone of ArchTitus to learn from and personalize
 
 This is a set of scripts to automate the tedious task of doing an Arch Linux installation. This is basically everything I would do by command line, condensed down into shell scripts. Of course this is personalized to load my laptop only. I would need to make a few edits to use it on my desktop PC.
 
This was a great learning experience for me. It was my first test of shell scripting. I think it was well worth my time and effort. I really enjoyed myself. I would recommed it highly.

I just ran a first test of this set of scripts.

BTRFS 

Minimal install with KDE desktop

Everything ran just fine.
